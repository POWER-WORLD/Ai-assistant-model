<h1>🤖 AI Assistant Model-</h1>
A simple and interactive AI Assistant built using Python and Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries. This assistant can recognize spoken commands, respond through speech, and perform basic tasks — creating an interactive desktop AI experience.

<h3>📌 Project Overview-</h3>

The AI Assistant acts as a smart virtual companion capable of:
<ul>
<li>Listening to your voice commands</li>
<li>Understanding and processing natural language queries</li>
<li>Responding through speech synthesis</li>
<li>Executing predefined actions (like searching, opening websites, telling the time)</li>
</ul>
This project serves as a beginner-friendly implementation of voice-based AI assistants in Python using open-source tools.

<h3>✨ Features-</h3>
✅ Speech-to-text voice recognition<br>
✅ Text-to-speech AI responses<br>
✅ Execute commands like:
<ul>
<li>Greet the user</li>
<li>Tell the current time</li>
<li>Search online</li>
<li>Open web pages </li>
</ul>
✅ Customizable command list<br>
✅ Runs directly on desktop (no internet APIs required)<br>
✅ Simple and readable Python code

<h3>🛠️ Technologies Used-</h3>

1. Python 3
2. SpeechRecognition — to convert speech to text
3. pyttsx3 — for text-to-speech conversion
4. datetime — for time-based responses
5. webbrowser — to open web pages
6. os — to execute system commands

<h3>🚀 Getting Started-</h3>

<b>📦 Requirements</b>

1. Python 3.x
2. Install the required libraries that are required for project

<b>📥 Installation</b>

Clone the repository:<br>
git clone https://github.com/POWER-WORLD/Ai-assistant-model.git

Navigate to the project directory:<br>
cd Ai-assistant-model

Install dependencies:<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the assistant:<br>
python main.py

<b>🎮 How It Works</b>
<ul>
<li>Listen for user’s voice input</li>
<li>Uses the SpeechRecognition library to capture audio from your microphone</li>
<li>Converts spoken words into text</li>
<li>Process the command</li>
<li>Recognizes keywords (like "time", "open YouTube", "search")</li>
<li>Executes actions based on the matched command</li>
<li>Respond through speech</li>
<li>Uses pyttsx3 for converting text responses into speech</li>
<li>Replies naturally to the user’s query</li>
</ul>

<b>🧠 Example Commands</b>
<ul>
<li>“Hello” → AI Assistant will greet you</li>
<li>“What’s the time” → Tells the current time</li>
<li>“Open YouTube” → Launches YouTube in your browser</li>
<li>“Search for Python tutorials” → Searches Python tutorials online</li>
<li>“Quit” → Exits the program</li>
</ul>
